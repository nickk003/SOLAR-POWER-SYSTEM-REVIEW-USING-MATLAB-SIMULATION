# SOLAR-POWER-SYSTEM-REVIEW-USING-MATLAB-SIMULATION
This project reviews solar power systems and simulates key components in MATLAB Simulink. It explores grid-tied, off-grid, and hybrid systems, analyzing solar panels, inverters, and batteries. Simulates PV arrays, DC choppers, and inverters, generating DC and AC waveforms. Includes energy consumption calculations and off-grid system design.
